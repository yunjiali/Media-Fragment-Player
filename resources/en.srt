5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,900
<i>I realize this even more these days,</i>

6
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,561
<i>when I open up my <br>eyes in the morning,</i>

7
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,298
<i>I'm so happy at the mere fact <br>that Seung Jo is next to me.</i>

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>Though it's already been a year <br>since we got married, <br>I still can't believe it.</i>

9
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>Does Seung Jo feel that way too?</i>

10
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,555
Good morning.

11
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,524
Did you sleep well?

12
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,692
Your stare is blinding.

13
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,527
Even more so than the sunlight.

14
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:38,366
It's Sunday.

15
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,833
Let's sleep some more.

16
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:43,370
I have to get up.

17
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:48,475
Everyone went on a trip and it's been a while since we've spent time together, just the two of us.

18
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:52,480
I'm going to make Seung Jo's breakfast myself.

19
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,616
Just 5 minutes.

20
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:05,866
Fine, just 5 minutes?

21
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,770
Did you sleep well, Seung Jo?

22
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:22,566
The sun hasn't even come up yet, <br>why did you set the alarm so early?!

23
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,813
Don't stare up at me with those swollen eyes!

24
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:42,663
<i>Everyone went on a trip, so <br>it's a Sunday with just Seung Jo.</i>

25
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:48,702
<i>Enjoy a perfect English <br>breakfast just like in the movies.</i>

26
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,874
<i>Clean the house with <br>Seung Jo until it's sparkling clean!</i>

27
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:56,110
<i>I want to show everyone the <br>image of a perfect daughter-in-law.</i>

28
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:01,582
<i>I also plan on watching a <br>romantic comedy with Seung Jo.</i>

29
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,385
<i>I'm so looking forward to today!</i>

30
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,121
What are you looking for, new bride?

31
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,324
New bride!

32
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,093
Me?!

33
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,229
Then what other new bride is there?

34
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,632
New bride?

35
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,469
That's right, I'm a new bride!

36
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,807
It's fresh, what do you think?

37
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,043
If you boil and marinate it, <br>it's really good!

38
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,745
Your husband will enjoy it!

39
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,146
Please give this to me.

40
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:37,284
And this one, and that one, and that one! Please give me one of each!

41
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:38,885
New bride!

42
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,301
Yes?

43
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,560
Go enjoy these with your husband. They're apples.

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,228
Thank you!

45
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,105
No, no, no!

46
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,307
What are you doing?!

47
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:04,311
Why are you eating this? Do you <br>know how important breakfast is?

48
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:09,015
Then again, where did you <br>go at the break of dawn?

49
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,689
Are you going to make a <br>feast for breakfast?

50
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,760
Just leave it up to me. Do you know how much I've looked forward to it being just the two of us?

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,461
Do you think you can do it by yourself?

52
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,197
You're not going to starve me, are you?

53
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:25,099
But I'm still a new bride.

54
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,001
There's no way I'll starve my hubby.

55
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,102
New bride?

56
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,738
Hubby?

57
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:36,344
I'll prepare breakfast, so hubby, please go wash up.

58
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:37,278
Hey.

59
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,914
Are you trying to play the role of <br>newlyweds just like in dramas?

60
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,683
We are newlyweds.

61
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,820
Stop dilly-dallying. Hurry and go up.

62
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,524
I put the laundry in the washer so start it for me too!

63
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,259
Let's just eat out.

64
00:04:52,333 --> 00:05:04,433
Please just go up.

65
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,186
English breakfast.

66
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,028
Alright!

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,500
Baek Seung Jo. Look forward to it!

68
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:12,168
Just like you, Oh Ha Ni.

69
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:37,100
Just like you, Oh Ha Ni.

70
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:57,300
Today's breakfast is the <br>unrecognizable English breakfast.

71
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:16,900
Everything else is overcooked like crazy, but the beans are undercooked.

72
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,606
I boiled them for a long time and they're still like that.

73
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,175
You should have let them sit in <br>water for a few hours beforehand.

74
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,710
Oh!

75
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,481
So this is the breakfast table of the new bride, Oh Ha Ni.

76
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,139
What about coffee?

77
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:43,433
Coffee!

78
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,902
The coffee tastes good.

79
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,573
Sorry.

80
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,081
That's right!

81
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:04,618
What is it?

82
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,623
The lady gave it to me. <br>She said to eat it with my hubby.

83
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,526
It's good. Try it.

84
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,328
Yours!

85
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,420
They say an apple in the morning is great! <br>It's really good, right?

86
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,875
An apple and coffee on Sunday morning...

87
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,378
Not bad.

88
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:34,982
I'll really do well tomorrow.

89
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,284
I've cleaned the whole house.

90
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,485
So...

91
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,421
The next course you've planned out.

92
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:42,656
Huh?

93
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:48,095
Picking out my clothes. <br>Oh, there was washing the blankets.

94
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,764
Let's do that at night.

95
00:08:50,164 --> 00:08:52,500
You knew all about it?

96
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,041
Oh, this is it!

97
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:07,815
English breakfast and coffee.

98
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,717
Great! It suits us perfectly!

99
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:15,689
And... I'll do the shopping early in the morning,

100
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,091
and pick out the freshest produce!

101
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,896
I'll come back and clean with Seung Jo.

102
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:25,466
I'll be a loved daughter-in-law and then...

103
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:31,238
Wash the blankets with the morning sunlight <br>pouring down on us. With tons of bubbles!

104
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:36,443
And once we're done, we'll go watch a movie.

105
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,147
Oh, I'll pick out Seung Jo's clothes!

106
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,849
A style that matches the autumn sunlight!

107
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,252
What'll look good?

108
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,221
I'll search for it!

109
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:55,866
You think with your mouth. <br>I couldn't ignore it even if I wanted to.

110
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:58,899
We've got to go watch a movie.

111
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,738
Yeah! Wait!

112
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:23,057
How is your outfit no different than mine?

113
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:26,060
Why?! It's pretty.

114
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:31,132
What's so pretty about it? Everyone is staring.

115
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,100
It's pretty.

116
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:35,603
Hold on.

117
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:52,887
Hubby!

118
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:56,757
What, wifey?

119
